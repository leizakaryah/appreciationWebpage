I was too scared to speak in front of everybody (virtually), but you helped me through it and I was able to face my fears. I remember when I told my siblings that I got you as my instructor. They were extremely excited cause they already knew that I would be in good hands. I gained a lot of confidence since our time together as a class, a lot of soft and hard skills that I could use until I grow old, and learned a lot of riddles that I wouldn't even have thought about. I would like to thank you for everything that you've done for us especially the extra projects that you've created and the resources you‚Äôve provided. We may not remember all of our lessons together (don't worry I'm just kidding), but we will remember you. ‚Äù</p>
